# 🛰️ Pixel Dweller — Live Tracker

**This file is the single source of truth.** Humans read it to watch progress.
Agents read it to know what to do next and to resume after a session/token reset.

> To resume in a new session: *"Read TRACKER.md and continue the autonomous build."*

## Control panel (edit these to steer the loop)

```yaml
paused: false            # set true to halt the cron loop immediately
max_tasks_per_day: 8     # cron stops after this many merged tasks/day
default_worker: opencode/big-pickle   # primary codegen model
escalation_worker: hermes/grok        # used after 2 failed attempts
reviewer: claude         # only Claude reviews/merges
retry_cap: 2             # attempts before escalating model
date: 2026-06-28
tasks_merged_today: 8
```
